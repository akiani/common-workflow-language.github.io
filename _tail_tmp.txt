The Common Workflow Language (CWL) is an informal, multi-vendor working group
consisting of various organizations and individuals that have an interest in
portability of data analysis workflows.  Our goal is to create specifications
that enable data scientists to describe analysis tools and workflows that are
powerful, easy to use, portable, and support reproducibility.

CWL builds on technologies such as [JSON-LD](http://json-ld.org) and
[Avro](https://avro.apache.org/) for data modeling and
[Docker](http://docker.com) for portable runtime environments.

CWL is designed to express workflows for data-intensive science, such as
Bioinformatics, Chemistry, Physics, and Astronomy.

## Current specification

http://common-workflow-language.github.io/draft-2/

Please be aware that Common Workflow Language is still under development.  The
current draft is draft 2.  This draft is not final.

## Implementations

Current work-in-progress implementations of the common workflow language:

* [Reference implementation (Python)](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/common-workflow-language/tree/master/reference/)
* [Rabix (Python)](https://github.com/rabix/rabix)

## Examples

[Github repository of example workflows.](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/workflows)

## Development and testing

[![Build Status](https://ci.curoverse.com/buildStatus/icon?job=common-workflow-language)](https://ci.curoverse.com/job/common-workflow-language/)

The CWL effort is on Github:

https://github.com/common-workflow-language/common-workflow-language

There is a Jenkins server maintained by Curoverse that runs tests for the
reference implementation, builds and uploads packages, and builds and uploads
Docker images:
